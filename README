RoundCube Webmail (http://roundcube.net)


Introduction:
-------------
RoundCube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect
from an e-mail client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation,
message searching and spell checking. RoundCube Webmail is written in PHP and
requires the MySQL or Postgres database. The user interface is fully skinnable
using XHTML and CSS 2.

This project is meant to be a modern webmail solution which is easy to
install/configure and that runs on a standard PHP plus MySQL or Postgres
configuration. It includes open-source classes/libraries like PEAR
(http://pear.php.net) and the IMAP wrapper from IlohaMail
(http://www.ilohamail.org).

The current development skin uses icons designed by Stephen Horlander and Kevin 
Gerich for Mozilla.org.


Installation:
-------------
For detailed instructions on how to install RoundCube webmail on your server,
please refer to the INSTALL document in the same directory as this document.


Licensing: 
----------
This product is distributed under the GPL. Please read through the file
LICENSE for more information about our license.


How it works:
-------------
The main authority for the RoundCube access is the IMAP server. If
'auto_create_user' is set to TRUE in config/main.inc.php a new record in the
user table will be created once the IMAP login succeeded. This user record does
not store a password, it's just used to assign identities, contacts and cache
records. If you have 'auto_create_user' set to FALSE only IMAP logins which
already have a corresponding entry in the user's table (username and hostname)
will be allowed.


Code Layout:
------------
Basic sequence (index.php):
  - index.php -> rcmail_load_gui -> new rcmail_template -> rcmail_template::send
  - authentication details in this sequence

Tasks
  - index.php limits tasks to set list
  - can see task in roundcube link when you mouse over it
  - task templates stored in skins/default/templates
  - templates "roundcube:" tokens that get replaced in rcmail_template class

program/include/rcube_shared.inc
  - defines rcube_html_page, class that lays out a roundcube web page
  - defines form control classes
  - provides common functions
