Roundcube Webmail (http://roundcube.net)


ATTENTION
---------
This is just a snapshot of the current SVN repository and is NOT A STABLE
version of Roundcube. It's not recommended to replace an existing installation
of Roundcube with this version. Also using a separate database for this
installation is highly recommended.


INTRODUCTION
------------
Roundcube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect
from an e-mail client, including MIME support, address book, folder management,
message searching and spell checking. Roundcube Webmail is written in PHP and
requires the MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database. With its plugin API it is
easily extendable and the user interface is fully customizable using skins
which are pure XHTML and CSS 2.

This project includes other open-source classes/libraries from PEAR
(http://pear.php.net), an IMAP library derived from IlohaMail
the TinyMCE rich text editor, Googiespell library for spell checking
or the HTML sanitizer by Frederic Motte.

The current default skin uses icons designed by Stephen Horlander and Kevin 
Gerich for Mozilla.org.

------------
For detailed instructions on how to install Roundcube webmail on your server,
