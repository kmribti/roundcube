RoundCube Webmail (http://roundcube.net)

Introduction:
-------------
RoundCube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect from
an e-mail client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation and
message filters. RoundCube Webmail is written in PHP and requires the MySQL
database. The user interface is fully skinnable using XHTML and CSS 2.

This project is meant to be a modern webmail solution which is easy to
install/configure and that runs on a standard PHP plus MySQL or Postgres
configuration. It includes open-source classes/libraries like PEAR
(http://pear.php.net) and the IMAP wrapper from IlohaMail
(http://www.ilohamail.org).

The current development skin uses icons designed by Stephen Horlander and Kevin 
Gerich for Mozilla.org.


How it works:
-------------
The main authority for the RoundCube access is the IMAP server. If
'auto_create_user' is set to TRUE in config/main.inc.php a new record in the
user table will be created once the IMAP login succeeded. This user record does
not store a password, it's just used to assign identities, contacts and cache
records. If you have 'auto_create_user' set to FALSE only IMAP logins which
already have a corresponding entry in the user's table (username and hostname)
will be allowed.
