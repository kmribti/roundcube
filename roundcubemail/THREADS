*** Current status of THREADS implementation ***

TODO (must have):
    - threads caching
    - better updating of threaded message list after message(s) deletion (?),
      in some cases  when some children rows has been removed threads needs
      to be reordered

TODO (other):
    - button in #listcontrols to mark all messages in current thread (with selected
      root or child message),

KNOWN ISSUES:
    - IE6: message, flag, attachment icons are not displayed in 
      initially collapsed child rows
