UPGRADING instructions
======================

Follow these instructions if upgrading from a previous version
of Roundcube Webmail. We recommend to carefully backup the existing
installation as well as the database before executig the following steps.

Using the update script
-----------------------
There is a shell script (for unix based systems) that does the job for you.
To use it, unpack the archive of the new Roundcube version to a temporary location (don't replace the Roundcube installation you want to update)
and cd into that directory. From there, run the following command in a shell:

  ./bin/installto.sh <TARGET-FOLDER>

For <TARGET-FOLDER> you specify the path to the Roundcube installation 
which should be updated. The update script will then copy all new files to the 
target location and check and update the configuration and database schema.
After all is done, the temporary folder with the new Roundcube files can be 
removed again.


Updating manually
-----------------
If you don't have shell access to the Roundcube instalaltion or if not running 
it on a unix system, you need to do the following operations by hand:

1. Replace index.php and all files in
   - ./bin/
   - ./SQL/
   - ./program/
   - ./installer/
   - ./skins/default/
   - ./plugins/
2. Run ./bin/update.sh from the commandline OR
   open http://url-to-roundcube/installer/ in a browser and choose "3 Test config".
   To enable the latter one, you have to temporary set 'enable_installer'
   to true in your local config/main.inc.php file.
3. Let the update script/installer check your configuration and
   update your config files and database schema as suggested by the updater.
4. Make sure 'enable_installer' is set to false again.
5. Check .htaccess settings (some php settings could become required)
