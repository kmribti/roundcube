INSTALLATION
============

1. Decompress and put this folder somewhere inside your document root
2. Make sure that the following directories (and the files within)
   are writable by the webserver
   - /temp
   - /logs
3. Create a new database and a database user for RoundCube (see DATABASE SETUP)
4. Create database tables using the queries in file 'SQL/*.initial.sql'
   (* stands for your database type)
5. Rename the files config/*.inc.php.dist to config/*.inc.php
6. Modify the files in config/* to suit your local environment
7. Done!


DATABASE SETUP
==============

* MySQL
-------
Setting up the mysql database can be done by creating an empty database,
importing the table layout and granting the proper permissions to the
roundcube user. Here is an example of that procedure:

# mysql
> create database 'roundcubemail';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON roundcubemail.* TO roundcube@localhost
        IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
> quit
# mysql roundcubemail < SQL/mysql.initial.sql

* SQLite
--------
Sqlite requires specifically php5 (sqlite in php4 currently doesn't
work with roundcube), and you need sqlite 2 (preferably 2.8) to setup
the sqlite db (sqlite 3.x also doesn't work at the moment). Here is
an example how you can setup the sqlite.db for roundcube:

# sqlite -init SQL/sqlite.initial.sql sqlite.db

Make sure your configuration points to the sqlite.db file and that the
webserver can write to the file.


UPGRADING
=========
If you already have a previous version of RoundCube installed,
please refer to the instructions in UPGRADING guide.


REQUIREMENTS
============

* The Apache Webserver
* .htaccess support allowing overrides for DirectoryIndex
* PHP Version 4.3.1 or greater
* php.ini options:
   - error_reporting E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE (or lower)
